# Line-Follower-Robot
The Line Follower Robot is an autonomous vehicle made using Arduino which was designed to follow a specific path marked by a line on the floor, typically a black line on a white background or vice versa. This project aims to provide an engaging and practical introduction to the world of robotics and embedded systems. By leveraging sensors to detect the line and control systems to manage the movement of the robot, this project illustrates the integration of hardware and software to achieve autonomous navigation.
